                    My name is Malorie Alyssa Lara.  I am 22 years old and enjoy many things, but 
                    particularly, spending time at home or with friends.  I am a home-body person 
                    but when I'm out with friends, I like to be active and social.  My family consists 
                    of my mom, Rebecca, dad, Jose, sister, Hailea, and two little dogs, Eloise and Hazel.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Throughout my life I have played many sports, but since I was 9, I have loved 
                    soccer the most.  When I was 10, I had a spiral fracture that you would think 
                    would have kept me from playing, but it didn't.  It actually made me that much 
                    more excited and tough for the upcoming seasons.  
                <br>
                <br>
                    When it came to college, I wanted to be close enough to home but also far enough 
                    to where I was able to become my own person and do my own things.  I chose a school 
                    that was about an hour away.  That school was Southwestern University.  I was able 
                    to fulfill my dreams and play soccer for the university at the collegiate level.  
                    I was also able to check off a goal when I scored my first collegiate hat-trick my 
                    sophomore year.  
                <br>

                        Some hobbies I enjoy are: Soccer/Sports, Kayaking, Paddleboarding, Swimming, 
                    Relaxing and sipping on Margs or a beer with my friends.
